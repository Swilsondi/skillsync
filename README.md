# SkillSync ðŸŽ¯

**SkillSync** is a full-stack project board application built for developers to post, claim, and collaborate on coding tasks. Designed to mimic real-world freelance tools like Trello or Upwork, this app reinforces backend logic, async JavaScript, and RESTful API design using a Node.js/Express + MongoDB stack â€” with a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

This app was created to:
- Reinforce intermediate JavaScript, backend routing, and asynchronous data flow
- Practice building scalable REST APIs with Node.js and Express
- Model and interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose
- Structure a professional-level full-stack application
- Integrate frontend and backend code using `fetch` and dynamic DOM updates
- Prepare for real-world developer environments by using Git, modular folder structures, and environment configs
