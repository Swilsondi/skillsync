ðŸŽ¯ Project Title: SkillSync â€“ A Developer-First Project Board

ðŸ’¡ Concept
Build a task and collaboration board app (like Trello meets a dev-focused Upwork board) where users can:

Post, categorize, and tag mini-projects or challenges.
Claim tasks or post help wanted.
Comment or discuss tasks (basic real-time-ish collaboration).
Track completion, difficulty level, and required skills.
The project serves a real need (developer networking and project practice) while pushing your backend skills, JavaScript logic, and MongoDB handling.
