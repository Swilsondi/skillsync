## ğŸ“… [Today's Date]

ğŸ§  What I Learned:

- Practiced `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`
- Understood how each one loops over arrays

ğŸ’¥ What Confused Me:

- [Write honestly if anything didnâ€™t make sense or felt weird]

ğŸ›  What I Built:

- arrayDrills.js with 4 examples

ğŸ“Œ Next Step:

- Try same drills inside a controller later (simulate real usage)
